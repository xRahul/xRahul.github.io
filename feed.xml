  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;objective&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since before the launch of Google stadia on November 19th, I’ve started seeing articles and videos on why Google stadia is going to fail, how the game collection is really bad, how they are using wires right now instead of going completely wireless, and I’m getting tired of everyone shutting stadia down without giving it a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people have even compared it to the other services that are going to launch like Microsoft’s xCloud and said how those were going to be better as they know the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just going to write about what got me excited about Stadia when it was launched, and why I still am as excited about the service as I was when they announced it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start with, I’m going to give a background. I am not a gamer. It’s not because I don’t like games. I do. I used to play a lot of games back in school when I had a computer. Back then, games like Midtown Madness didn’t ask you for overclocked octa cores or having teraflops of graphics just to enjoy some downtime. I could enjoy almost any famous game without having to ask my parents to spend an arm and a leg on a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Games didn’t use to ask for octa cores and teraflops of graphics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After school, it got real. When you’re working on a limited budget and trying to get into Computer Science, your system becomes something more than a downtime. You have to decide on what to buy based on research, use case and something that will help and be there for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And research I did. After months, I concluded that Macbook Pro would be a good investment (in 2011) when all my friends were buying Windows laptops with loudspeakers and amazing graphics. I still remember the conversation I had with my cousin. He said- If you’re sure about it, know that you’ll never be able to play games like you used to. The model I opted for had no graphics card, and with 4GB RAM, around 300MBs of Integrated graphics, how can you even argue that. And I know it was a good decision because I’m typing this article on that same laptop 9 years later, now upgraded to 16gigs and SSD, running better than the day I purchased it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re sure about buying a macbook, know that you’ll never be able to play games like you used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have thought about getting a new laptop or a console for gaming so many times since, but it just never made sense to spend money frivolously when I knew there’s no future for that device after a couple of years. Shifting every few of years doesn’t work with lugging a console and a TV around. Getting a bulky laptop for everyday use when I knew I’m only going to play games rarely never made sense. And games are becoming crazily graphics intensive that the systems now start with a couple of thousand dollars with decent graphics. When the lowest recommendation is 4 gigs of VRAM with a 7th Gen i5, you know where we are heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you’re on the move every few years, you can’t really get into consoles or bulky systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember being excited when I got a good enough smartphone that maybe I can finally game, but, well, have you seen what mobile versions of games are like? Civilisation, Age of Empires… They are so bad that I feel for the franchise after playing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gaming on mobile is just…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;then-google-announces-stadia&quot;&gt;Then google announces Stadia.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been moving away from CDs and DVDs for so long now. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ etc would never have thrived if we had kept saying how buffering is bad, the collection limited and kept buying CDs for the movies instead of shifting to streaming services. Was your internet that good when Netflix came that you instantly switched over? Has it always been cheap and buffering free browsing YouTube? Not for me at least. I remember pausing the youtube video every time I open it and allow it to buffer enough so that I can watch it uninterrupted. How many of you still prefer buying CD players? Or have CD players in their systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Moving from CDs to streaming was also shaky at the beginning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think just like back then, the industry is afraid of what Google can do with streaming games. All the Xboxes and PlayStations have to start working on cloud offerings now or become as obsolete as the CD players now are. And with how many data centres Google has and the low latencies and streaming experience it has, I can say they did an amazing job with Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;117ms is what I saw in one of the youtube reviews. 117ms of latency for a game running thousands of miles away on servers. The path being instructions going from your stadia controller to the servers through all the internet congestion, through the OSI layers or however they are sending the signals, their servers processing it all in real-time and sending back 4K video, again, all of this in under 117 ms. That just blows my mind. PUBG on my mobile has that kind of latency and that’s actually running on my system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having just 117 latency for 4k heavy duty games at launch is simply amazing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that all those FPS games will suffer in these latencies. Or games like DOTA will due to them requiring really fast response rates to be competitive. But I think Stadia at launch is not really for those types of games. I can see games like Planet Zoo, Civilisation 6, Cities Skyline etc thriving on Stadia right from the get-go. The only obstacle I can see to that is the Vulkan which I think will catch on really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FREE 1080P gaming&lt;/strong&gt;. How are you not get excited over that? Just pay for the game and you can play it for free forever or as long as google keeps it free. How can you not be excited over that? It just boggles my mind when people are not shouting how good these offerings are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Free 1080p gaming at 60fps is a really good offering for those without a gaming device&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new game is out but the system you bought doesn’t really support even the lowest settings anymore? Yeah, time to spend thousands of dollars to play that game now. How does that even make sense to anyone? Oh, you like Pokemon? Time to buy Nintendo Switch, even though the only games you might play on that are Pokemon and Zelda. New spiderman game is out, but you have to get Playstation to play that, or Xbox for the Halo fans. You might be made out of money, but I sure am not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Market is too scattered in franchises and devices to always keep wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no different than shifting from CD players to streaming services, from owning expensive servers to data centres and renting the servers from them. You think it’s easy to even get 117ms latency? It is so bad for others that Cloudflare’s premium 1.1.1.1 Wrap+ is a service that helps you avoid internet congestion to get better latency and speeds. While the world has shifted to streaming everything, the Internet is the one to suffer the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The tech behind Stadia is a complex problem that Google has amazingly tried to solve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it might sound like I’m a google’s fanboy here or just too blinded to the flaws of Stadia, but believe me, I’m not. I’ve always been more data-driven in how I spend my money. I need to be able to justify myself that the money I’m spending was a well thought out decision with pros and cons balanced. A service promising free 1080p 60fps gaming on any platform with reasonably low latencies backed with 10.7 teraflops of graphics only asking to purchase the games? I’m in. This is just like renting out the data centres to play games which seems amazing to me. I can’t even begin to comprehend the complexities behind a project like this. But I can appreciate the effort made by the stadia team here and hope that they launch in Singapore soon (I know you have a data centre in Singapore google. In a city with dedicated data centre for lowest latencies.. Why have you not launched here?!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just launch in Singapore, will you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You can find details in the references I’m providing below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a utility I’ve used recently and would like to give it a shoutout while explaining how it helped me. The task was to upgrade a web server from using TLSv1.0 to TLSv1.2 SSL encryption. If you’re unaware, older versions of TLS and SSL have &lt;em&gt;unfixable threats&lt;/em&gt; that can be utilized by hackers to gain access to your valuable data. It is also a matter of compliance now for systems that require high-security standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html&quot;&gt;added TLSv1.2 support in my Tomcat server&lt;/a&gt;, setup mutual auth with an older client and was in the middle of testing the upgrade, when the client received &lt;strong&gt;SSL Handshake error&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, this error can occur due to any number of reasons, and unlike curl output that gives very detailed information on SSL Handshake as you can see below, The application just returned a very unhelpful stacktrace with the message: SSL Handshake error&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;curl&quot;&gt;Curl&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;○ → curl -v https://rahulja.in

&amp;gt; GET / HTTP/2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above curl output, you can see that the SSL Handshake succeeded with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Finished (20):&lt;/code&gt;, you can see the cipher used for SSL &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TLSv1.2 / ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305&lt;/code&gt; and even that HTTP2 is being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I needed a way to get some of the above details using some other method. This is when I stumbled upon nmap. The result I received was precisely what I wanted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;command&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;○ → nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 rahulja.in
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above there, you can easily see that with a simple command, you can see all the supported TLS versions and ciphers they support. After this information, it is just a matter of checking whether your client can use the ciphers supported by the server and you’re good to go. Check out the references for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve worked in Java, you probably have encountered Gradle by now, be it in an Android or a Spring Application. Whether you have used Gradle or not, It’s good to know one of the leading build tools in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gradle.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt; is the next evolutionary step in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;JVM&lt;/a&gt;-based build tools. It draws on lessons learned from established tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ant.apache.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; and takes their best ideas to the next level. Following a build-by-convention approach, Gradle allows for declaratively modelling your problem domain using a powerful and expressive domain-specific language (DSL) implemented in &lt;a href=&quot;http://groovy-lang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt; instead of XML. Because Gradle is a JVM native, it allows you to write custom logic in the language you’re most comfortable with, be it Java or Groovy.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drdobbs.com/jvm/why-build-your-java-projects-with-gradle/240168608&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gradle builds are not just for Java applications. You can leverage Gradle to help you build applications in Java, C++, Python or your language of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;official tutorials&lt;/a&gt; for Android, C++, Groovy, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin and Scala under Project Tutorials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;install&quot;&gt;Install&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install Gradle, please follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradle.org/install/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;official docs&lt;/a&gt; to get up to date installation instructions. Installation using package manager is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-concepts&quot;&gt;Basic concepts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Gradle &lt;strong&gt;Build&lt;/strong&gt; can have multiple &lt;strong&gt;Projects&lt;/strong&gt; which in turn can have multiple &lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gradle.properties&lt;/code&gt; file is required to configure the build and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;settings.gradle&lt;/code&gt; file is required for multi-project builds to tell Gradle which projects to build.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gradle supports &lt;strong&gt;Plugins&lt;/strong&gt;, which contains dependencies, tasks and configurations(like source location) that can be applied to our build and make Gradle easy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-a-java-application-using-gradle&quot;&gt;Building a Java Application using Gradle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;java-demo &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;java-demo
gradle init &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--type&lt;/span&gt; java-application&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gradle comes with a built-in plugin called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_init_plugin.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Init Plugin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You can see the details of building a Java application in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.gradle.org/building-java-applications/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;official docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It generates the default &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; folders for the source code along with other configurational files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; file contains &lt;em&gt;java&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; plugins, a class name for the entry point of &lt;strong&gt;jar&lt;/strong&gt;, the public Bintray Artifactory repository and some dependencies to help with the development and testing of the application.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because the Gradle build used the Application plugin, you can use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./gradlew run&lt;/code&gt; command to Build, Test and Execute the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;important-components-of-gradle&quot;&gt;Important components of Gradle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gradle-wrapper&quot;&gt;Gradle Wrapper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the recommended way to build a Gradle project. When you initialize a Gradle project, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;gradle wrapper&lt;/a&gt; is set up automatically which can be executed just like Gradle as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./gradlew &amp;lt;task&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradle changes a lot with its upgrades and the old &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gradle.build&lt;/code&gt; files might not work for the newer versions. Gradle Wrapper automatically downloads and uses the recommended version of Gradle to execute your tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;gradle wrapper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to push the Gradle wrapper files to &lt;strong&gt;Version control&lt;/strong&gt; like git, including &lt;strong&gt;jars&lt;/strong&gt;, so everyone can use the same wrapper to build your projects
You can &lt;strong&gt;upgrade&lt;/strong&gt; the Gradle wrapper via it’s CLI to make sure any other optimizations present in the build are also applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./gradlew wrapper &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--gradle-version&lt;/span&gt; 4.2.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gradle-daemon&quot;&gt;Gradle Daemon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This daemon runs in the background on your system and helps builds run faster by avoiding the expensive bootstrapping process as well as leveraging caching, by keeping data about your project in memory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gradle Daemon is enabled by default starting with Gradle 3.0, so it requires no setup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In between builds, it waits idly for the next build. This has the obvious benefit of only requiring Gradle to be loaded into memory once for multiple builds, as opposed to once for each build.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Daemon can also leverage caching and can progressively become more optimal with each rebuild to decrease the build times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/command_line_interface.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gradle CLI Docs&lt;/a&gt; to see what else you can do;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dependency-management-with-gradle&quot;&gt;Dependency management with Gradle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the major feature provided by a build system. Dependency management is a technique for declaring, resolving and using dependencies required by the project in an automated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some widely used public &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;repositories&lt;/a&gt; of Gradle like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mavenCentral()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jcenter()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google()&lt;/code&gt;. But you can also define other repositories by url, even the ones secure access via credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;types of dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-gradle&quot; data-lang=&quot;gradle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Module dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;group:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'org.springframework'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'spring-core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;version:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'2.5'&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// File Dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'libs/a.jar'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'libs/b.jar'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;compile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;$buildDir/classes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;builtBy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'compile'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Project dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;compile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;':shared'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As web developers, we use Javascript in our daily life but rarely do we take out the time and learn intricacies of the language. We accept many things at face value as they do not impact the work we need to do and make assumptions about other things that are mostly correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once you know you will be working on something for a long time, it’s time to put the foot down and start learn things properly to qualify from development to engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some topics that will help you get an overview of the Whats and the Hows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;scopes&quot;&gt;Scopes&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scope determines the visibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;Execution Context&lt;/em&gt; (Not to be confused with &lt;em&gt;Context&lt;/em&gt; below)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Types of Scopes:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Local&lt;/em&gt; - Variables defined inside a function are not available outside that function&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global&lt;/em&gt; - Variables defined outside any scope and can be accessed anywhere in the code&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lexical&lt;/em&gt; - Variables from parent scope are available inside the nested scopes.
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Scope Chain: When accessing a variable, JS will start searching from the current scope, and keep jumping up in nested scopes to find it.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bike&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;wheels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// bike variable is in global scope&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ride&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// speed variable is in local scope of ride function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;context--this-keyword&quot;&gt;Context &amp;amp; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Developers generally get confused between scope and context. Context is used to refer to the value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; variable in some place in the code.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Generally, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword in a context refers to the object it was called against, i.e. the variable left of the dot in a function call.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fn_ride&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bike&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;wheels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// bike variable is in global scope&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ride&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fn_ride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// `ride()` points to `fn_ride()` in which `bike` will be logged&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// `ride()` function was called in context of `bike`.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// So, `this` will point to `bike` inside fn_ride function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// during the `bike.ride()` call.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// here you're changing the context from `bike` to `car`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;closures&quot;&gt;Closures&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It is created when an inner function tries to access the variables defined in and arguments passed into the outer function.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Even when the inner function is called outside the outer function, those variables will be available to the closure.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;These are the functions to the right of class definition.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The constructor function is nothing more than a normal function.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;prototype&quot;&gt;Prototype&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a default attribute in every javascript function.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It points to an object in which properties and functions of a class can be assigned that should be usable by every object of that class(object of the constructor function).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Every object has a prototype that can be modified through the constructor’s prototype.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the current scope doesn’t have the accessed attribute, the prototype of that function is checked before going to outer nesting.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Every prototype has a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/code&gt; property that points to the class(Constructor function) of that prototype.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some time, it’ll start to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;compressions&lt;/code&gt; to store old data in RAM to make way for fresh data. And after that, it’ll start to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;swaps&lt;/code&gt; on your hard disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This usage of swap results in a lot of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reads/writes&lt;/code&gt; in the hard disk, which can result in less responsive mac in case of HDD and shortening of life in SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a script you can schedule to run however and whenever you want using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;crontab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;applescript&lt;/code&gt;. It checks various RAM stats like compressions and swap usage and notifies when they are being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, it’s scheduled to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;run every hour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and to check these RAM parameters-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compressions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decompressions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swapins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swapouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/xRahul/a787f0c4eebfadf7af5beafdb99f9fe7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the code. Just download the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;applescript&lt;/code&gt; file, and set it up using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;crontab&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linter (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;php -l&lt;/code&gt;). This provides a convenient way to perform only a syntax check on the given PHP code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PHP CodeSniffer&lt;/a&gt; 1.3+ (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;phpcs&lt;/code&gt;). It tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding standard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://phpmd.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PHP Mess Detector&lt;/a&gt; 1.4+ (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;phpmd&lt;/code&gt;). It detects and reports various potential problems with the code like possible bugs, suboptimal code, overcomplicated expressions and unused parameters, methods, properties.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/pfff/wiki/Scheck&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Scheck&lt;/a&gt; 0.23+ (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scheck&lt;/code&gt;, part of Facebook’s pfff toolchain). This will help you find stupid mistakes like a typo in your code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-can-also-configure-the-plugin-to-fix-the-issues-using-either&quot;&gt;You can also configure the plugin to fix the issues using either&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PHP Coding Standards Fixer&lt;/a&gt; 0.2+ (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;php-cs-fixer&lt;/code&gt;). It can fix most issues in your code when you want to follow the PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1 and PSR-2 documents and many more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PHP Code Beautifier&lt;/a&gt; 2.2.0+ (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;phpcbf&lt;/code&gt;). It can automatically correct coding standard violations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plugin has been tested on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mac OS X 10.8.2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 11.10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windows 7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sublime Text 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sublime Text 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-sublime-phpcs&quot;&gt;Install sublime-phpcs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using Sublime Text’s Package Control &lt;em&gt;(recommended)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Preferences&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Package Control&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Install Package&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Phpcs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or via git checkout in Sublime Text packages&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Simply checkout the git repo into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text [VERSION NUMBER]/Packages/&lt;/code&gt; for MacOSX or the equivalent folder on Windows or Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/Library/Application&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;Support/Sublime&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;Text&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;2/Packages/
git clone git://github.com/benmatselby/sublime-phpcs.git Phpcs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-dependencies&quot;&gt;Install dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/manual/en/install.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;php&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; installed on your system and check that you can use it directly-&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;php &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt;
    PHP 5.6.28 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cli&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;built: Dec  6 2016 12:38:54&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now you need to have the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;composer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; installed. Use the provided link to move it globally.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PHP CodeSniffer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://phpmd.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PHP Mess Detector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PHP CS Fixer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PHP Code Beautifier&lt;/a&gt; globally. You can also follow the links to see the install instructions for each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;composer global require squizlabs/php_codesniffer
composer global require phpmd/phpmd
composer global require friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please note the absolute path of all the installed packages (On a Mac/Linux based environment), you can use:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;which phpcs
which phpmd
which php-cs-fixer
which phpcbf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now install Scheck dependencies.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; installed.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Follow the instructions here for generic, macosx and linux to install only these two packages- &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ocaml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;camlp4&lt;/code&gt;. You do not need the other packages like GTK, Cairo, SWI-prolog or Java for scheck.
For macosx, use &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/using-homebrew-on-macosx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# for macosx using homebrew&lt;/span&gt;
brew &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;objective-caml camlp4

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# for fedora, you may need to install these too&lt;/span&gt;
yum &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;ocaml-camlp4 ocaml-camlp4-devel perl-pod-usage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now install &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/pfff/wiki/Main#install&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Scheck&lt;/a&gt;. If you follow the instructions mentioned in their project, you can download and setup the entire &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pfff&lt;/code&gt; set of tools. But for our case, we just need the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scheck&lt;/code&gt; part. So, follow these instructions to get just that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After following the steps, you’ll find a file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scheck&lt;/code&gt; in your cloned repo. Please note the absolute path of that as you’ll need it later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# clone their github repository somewhere&lt;/span&gt;
git clone https://github.com/facebook/pfff.git &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--depth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# build pfff tools&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;path_to_cloned_github_repository&amp;gt;
./configure &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-novisual&lt;/span&gt;
make depend
make&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now you just need to setup the configuration for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sublime-phpcs&lt;/code&gt; package in sublime text.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Preferences&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Package Settings&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PHP Code Sniffer&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Settings - User&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add the following json configuration-&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpcs_php_path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/usr/bin/php&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpcs_executable_path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/.composer/vendor/bin/phpcs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpmd_executable_path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/.composer/vendor/bin/phpmd&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpcbf_executable_path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/.composer/vendor/bin/phpcbf&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;scheck_executable_path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/Documents/GitHub/pfff/scheck&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;php_cs_fixer_executable_path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/.composer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpmd_run&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;scheck_run&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpcs_linter_run&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpcs_sniffer_run&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;extensions_to_blacklist&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpcs_execute_on_save&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpcs_show_errors_on_save&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpcs_command_on_save&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;php_cs_fixer_on_save&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpcbf_on_save&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpcs_linter_command_on_save&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;phpmd_command_on_save&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;scheck_command_on_save&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above configuration, replace the paths with your install paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also use either &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;php_cs_fixer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;phpcbf&lt;/code&gt; for fixing the errors. I’d recommend using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;phpcbf&lt;/code&gt; as that is already isntalled with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;phpcs&lt;/code&gt; and thus you won’t have to install &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;php_cs_fixer&lt;/code&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am disabling anything happening on save, but you can change the configuration any way you want. Find the defaults here-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Preferences&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Package Settings&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PHP Code Sniffer&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Settings - Default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you just need to do &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cmd&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shift&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; and look for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sniff&lt;/code&gt; options.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a mac, you need to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt; installed on it. It is the best package manager for mac, and in their own words-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Homebrew installs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/tree/master/Formula&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the stuff you need&lt;/a&gt; that Apple didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt;. To &lt;em&gt;install homebrew&lt;/em&gt;, check out simple instructions provided on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;. Homebrew deals with formulas, which are basically package definitions written in Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;below-is-a-cheatsheet-of-basic-brew-commands&quot;&gt;Below is a cheatsheet of basic brew commands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--verbose&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt;, many commands print extra debugging information. Note that these flags should only appear after a command.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew --version&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Shows current version (&lt;em&gt;1.1.9 at the time of this post&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Install formula&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew uninstall&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Uninstall formula&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fetch the newest version of Homebrew from &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;List all installed formulae&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew search text|/text/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Perform a substring search of formula names as string or regex&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew analytics (on|off)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Turn on/off Homebrew’s analytics&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew deps (formulae)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew doctor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Check your system for potential problems with brew installations&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew info (formula)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Display information about formula&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew leaves&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Show installed formulae that are not dependencies of another installed formula&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew outdated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Show formulae that have an updated version available&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew prune&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Remove dead symlinks from the Homebrew prefix&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew reinstall (formula)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Uninstall and then install formula&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew tap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;List all installed taps (&lt;em&gt;A tap is a repository of formulae&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew untap (tap)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Remove a tapped repository&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew --cellar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Display the location where formula would be installed&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew cleanup (formula)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;For specific formulae, remove any older versions from the cellar.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew cleanup -n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;It shows what would be removed, but does not actually remove anything&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew cask cleanup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;cleanup in any installed casks&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew cask list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;list all installed casks&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have installed homebrew and started using it, maintenance is required regularly to keep the packages up to date, clearing out the old and checking if everything installed is working correctly. Use this command to do all that at once-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;brew update &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; brew upgrade &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; brew cleanup &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; brew cask cleanup&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; brew doctor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or better yet, create an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt; of this run that with single word command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brewski&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;alias brewski='brew update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew upgrade &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew cleanup &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew cask cleanup; brew doctor'&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; ~/.bash_profile
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; ~/.bash_profile
brewski&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps to get your whatsapp data in decrypted form-
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;em&gt;Crypt Key Extractor&lt;/em&gt;  from &lt;a href=&quot;http://whatcrypt.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;WhatCrypt&lt;/a&gt; homepage or you can download it from their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EliteAndroidApps/WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor/archive/master.zip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt; directly.
&lt;br /&gt;
Prerequisites-
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;O/S: Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Mac OS X or Linux&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Java - If not installed: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.java.com/en/download/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.java.com/en/download/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;ADB (Android Debug Bridge) Drivers: &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/install-adb-drivers-on-your-system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out my post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Android device with Android 4.0 or higher.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;USB Debugging must be enabled on the target device.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Developer Options&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; (Debugging) &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;USB debugging&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 If you cannot find &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Developer Options&lt;/code&gt; then please go to:
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;About phone/device&lt;/code&gt; and tap the Build number multiple times until you’re finally declared a developer.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extract &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor-master.zip&lt;/code&gt; maintaining the directory structure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WhatsAppKeyDBExtract.bat&lt;/code&gt; (Windows) or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WhatsAppKeyDBExtract.sh&lt;/code&gt; (Mac OS X / Linux).
&lt;br /&gt;Or go to the extracted folder via terminal and run the file as
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sh WhatsAppKeyDBExtract.sh&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some things to keep in mind for this step-
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This step uses the internet to download a legacy version of WhatsApp (2.11) to install on your phone. So make sure your PC is connected to the internet before running it.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure there is no overlay active on your phone like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Twilight&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Blue Light Filter&lt;/code&gt;, as these will not allow you to click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Back up my data&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect your device via USB, change the mode from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;charging&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;media&lt;/code&gt;, unlock your screen and wait for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Full backup&lt;/code&gt; to appear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter your backup password or leave blank (if none set) and tap on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Back up my data&lt;/code&gt;. This step takes some time depending on the size of your data. So be patient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm backup password in your command console and then check your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;extracted&lt;/code&gt; folder. You will find many files there- &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;axolotl.db&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chatsettings.db&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;msgstore.db&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wa.db&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;whatsapp.cryptkey&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All these &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.db&lt;/code&gt; files are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sqlite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; databases in unencrypted form. Use a database viewer like &lt;a href=&quot;http://sqlitebrowser.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;DB Browser for SQLite&lt;/a&gt; to see the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Google collectively refers to ADB, fastboot, and a few other utilities as the Platform Tools package and has provided them separately now. This post is assuming you don’t have android sdk or android studio installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;install-adb-on-macosx-using-homebrew&quot;&gt;Install adb on MacOSX using &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the easiest way and will provide automatic updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Install homebrew&lt;/span&gt;
ruby &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-fsSL&lt;/span&gt; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Install adb&lt;/span&gt;
brew &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;android-platform-tools

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# run&lt;/span&gt;
adb devices&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;install-adb-manually&quot;&gt;Install adb manually&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download your OS-specific zip of platform tools from &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html#download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extract the contents of the .zip file to a folder you can find later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Navigate to the extracted folder using your terminal, and there you will find the adb command.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run the command normally once you’re into the extracted folder- &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;adb devices&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

You can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/manual/en/class.curlfile.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;CURLFile&lt;/a&gt; class or &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/manual/en/function.curl-file-create.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;curl_file_create()&lt;/a&gt; to upload a file with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Create a CURLFile object / procedural method&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$cfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_file_create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'resource/test.png'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'image/png'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'testpic'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// try adding&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Create a CURLFile object / oop method&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$cfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'resource/test.png'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'image/png'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'testpic'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for older versions, it’s a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, you can not send files using the GET method.  That doesn’t even make sense. Also, you need the absolute path of the file. Relative paths won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sample code that will work-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Create a string with file data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$cfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;@&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$fileAbsolutePath&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;;type=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mime_content_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$fileAbsolutePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;;filename=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;basename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$fileAbsolutePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above code has 3 parts-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;@&quot; . $fileAbsolutePath&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This gives the cURL library full path to the file so it knows which file to send.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;;type=&quot; . mime_content_type($fileAbsolutePath)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is used to set a MIME Content-type for the uploaded file. Without it, MIME type defaults to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;application/octet-stream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;;filename=&quot; . basename($fileAbsolutePath)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is used to give the uploaded file a new name. Use this to change the name of the file that is received by the server on which request is sent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$cfile&lt;/code&gt; variable to send the file by setting it as a parameter to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// initialise the curl request&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$conn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://abc.xyz'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// send a file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'file'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;realpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'example.txt'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// output the response&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_setopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// close the session&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;curl_close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
